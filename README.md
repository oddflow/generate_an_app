# Project Description

Your challenge this week is to build an app by generating 100% of the code. Well technically it might be 99% because we know that GenAI doesn’t already produce code that works, so you may have to fix some of the bugs, making it 99% not 100%.

You will have 2 weeks in teams to generate code and produce your small app.

In the 3rd week, we will collectively do peer reviews on the code that was produced.

There might be good code, there might be crappy code - time will tell!

This is an interesting exercise for you to explore how far GenAI can or cannot go in code generation for an entire application.

You may succeed, but you may not if the GenAI tool is unable to generate code correctly.

We do not want you to use code completion - we want you to prompt an LLM model and use it to generate code. Use whichever model you wish.

Pick one of the following projects as an app to generate:
Basic table reservation system for a cafe or restaurant (medium)
Shopping list app (medium)
Restaurant website (easy)


A note pad (medium)
Meal tracker app (harder)
Or choose your own simple app to build!

You can use any language you want - there are no restrictions. The goal is just to have something that works!

You can use GenAI to generate a list of requirements or ideas for what you actually and specifically want to build in the app.

Requirements:
The app must have a front-end interface that can be used
The app should be use-able and you should be able to demo what it can do
Host it locally or you can deploy on the cloud using a free tool
The backend is up to you! We won’t require a database of a specific type, but again, the app has to work so make your decisions accordingly
